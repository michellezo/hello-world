# hello-world
This is my first foray into learning to code. Already I am seeing that this is going to be a bit difficult, but I am determined to succeed.
I have over 20 years of customer service background, but no college degree. I have sadly found myself needing to make more income to allow for the things I want out of life, and have decided to learn to code so that I can stop dreaming and start doing.
